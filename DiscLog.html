    <h2>Week 1:</h2>
    <h3>26/09/18</h3>
    <p>Discovered google docs! This is my first time using Google drive and Google docs, so far so good. Set my password for the VM today and everything looks very foreign, never heard of a VM before, mine works fine though, I think….</p>
            
    <p>Will have to research into how a literature review must be written, this is our first bit of coursework and has been issued already.</p>
        
    <p>One of todays tasks is called 'Website awards', reviewing good and bad websites. Had to type website reviews into a google form and submit it for… not sure what for.</p>
        
    <p>GOOD: http://google.co.uk
    I can search for anything that I need, its the website I go to first as its quicker to google a website and follow the link rather than type the website in the URL bar. I can use it as a scientific calculator, a dictionary, a shop, a map etc.</p>
        
    <p>BAD: https://www.prettylittlething.com/
    The stock is always out of date, you add an item to your basket then it notifies you upon checkout that it is out of stock. Sometimes it will allow you to order an item, then email you the next day saying its out of stock and will be processing a refund.</p>
            
    <h3>27/09/18:</h3>
    <p>Started looking at the coursework today  googled what mitigating means and how to write a review.</p>

    <p>Mitigating: Making something less severe, serious or painful</p>

    <p>Literature Review Topic: Mitigating personal information exposure on the web.</p>
    
    <p>How to write a literature review…</p>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>The introduction explains the focus and establishes the importance of the subject. It discusses what kind of work has been done on the topic and identifies any controversies within the field or any recent research which has raised questions about earlier assumptions. It may provide a background or history. It concludes with a purpose of thesis statement. In a stand-alone literature review, this statement will sum up and evaluate the state of art in this field of research; in a review that is an introduction or preparatory to a thesis or research report, it will suggest how the review findings will lead to the research the writer proposes to undertake.</p>
        
        
    <p>A concise definition of a topic under consideration (this may be a descriptive or argumentative thesis, or proposal), as well as the scope of the related literature being investigated. (Example: If the topic under consideration is ‘women’s wartime diaries’, the scope of the review may be limited to published or unpublished works, works in English, works from a particular location, time period, or conflict, etc.) • The introduction should also note intentional exclusions. (Example: “This review will not explore the diaries of adolescent girls.”) • Another purpose of the introduction is to state the general findings of the review (what do most of the sources conclude), and comment on the availability of sources in the subject area. </p>
        
    <h4>Body</h4>
    <p>Often divided by headings/subheadings, the body summarizes and evaluates the current state of knowledge in the field. It notes major themes or topics, the most important trends, and any findings about which researchers agree of disagree.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>The conclusion summarizes all the evidence presented and shows its significance. If the review is an introduction to your own research, it highlights gaps and indicates how previous research leads to your own research project and chosen methodology. If the review is a stand-alone assignment for a course it should suggest any practical applications of the research as well as the implications and possibilities for future research.</p>

    <p>Found some websites and books to looks into, could be used for references:</p>

        <li>Finding and fixing vulnerabiliies in information systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>How to looks for sources… Look for the following:
    Claims, conclusions, and findings about the constructs you are investigating
    Definitions of terms
    Calls for follow-up studies relevant to your project
    Gaps you notice in the literature
    Disagreement about the constructs you are investigating</p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <h3>03/10/18</h3>
        <p>Today we looked at web security, discussed and listed all the different kinds of information that we generate on a day to day basis. Opened and shared a google doc, found out we can all type into the same document at the same time. Like it.</p>
        <p>I am going to try and visit the libary this week to start searching for possible references.</p>
    </section>

    <section id=link>
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h3>10/10/19</h3>
    <p>So a literature review is solely about reviewing the literature surrounding a topic, think I'm going to find it hard not to give my own opinion.</p>
    <p>Summary of what experts say to do to reduce personal information exposure on the web.</p>
    <p>Now that we've done some reading, we must list a few search items that we will use to find literature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ransomware</li>
        <li>Social network information exposure</li>
        <li>Data leaks</li>
        <li>Mitigating a data breach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We have been given a template for recording references and structured notes:</p>

    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <h3>15/10/18</h3>
    <p>A group coggle has been made for students to submit ideas and themes for coursework</p>
    
    <h3>17/10/18</h3>
    <p>We have made another group google doc for today's task; replacing phrasal verbs with cues. We got through this task quite quickly, and I can see that this will definitely help with how to word my literature review.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <h3>24/10/18</h3>
    <p>So I didn’t end up downloading an editor on the first week, so have had to get that done today to complete today's task. Just using Notepad++, looks quite simple, am going to download VS code before next week.</p>
    <p>The lecture at the start of the week, although introduced HTML, didn’t teach me much so today's task was quite hard to complete. Having had no former experience with HTML, I had to keep interrupting students sat near me and asking lecturers for help.</p>
    <p>I have learnt that index.html must be used for the home page when creating a website. I have downloaded more software (WinSCP) which enables me to upload HTML docs to my VM. With help, I managed to get this done.</p>

    <h3>26/10/18</h3>
    <p>I submitted my literature reviews today. Looking forward to seeing what my feedback is like when it comes back.</p>

    <p>Today I downloaded Visual Studio for program writing</p>
    <p>We had to create a file called example.html and insert some content.</p>
    <p>If a document is saved as .html, it can open in a web browser.</p>        
    <p>We had an introduction to style, changing the colour of font to red, font to sans-serif, and font size 130%</p>
    <p>NB: The stylesheet only needs to be placed in a style element when it is embedded. When it is in its own file (e.g. in the next task) it cannot be surrounded with tags.</p>
    <p>Now a linked stylesheet, which is .css. As it is not a HTML sheet, I do not need to include the use of the style tags. Didn’t get time for the rest of the worksheet.</p>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 8:</h2>
    <h3>14/11/18</h3>
    <p>Now we have to download another editor?! Different people are saying to use different editors, I'm not quite sure who to listen to. I've downloaded atom as well, but I am quite happy with Visual Studio code right now. Found a theme with my name on it, and I'm sold to Visual studio.</p>
    <p>I'm confused with everything HTML at the moment, another student has recommended codeacademy to help me learn. I signed up to this today and worked my way through a simple exercise.</p>

    <h3>21/11/18</h3>
    <p>We sorted a selection of cards into groups and presented to the class to see how each of us grouped the cards. I didn't find this practical all that informative as sometimes in group work people get distacted and mess around. </p>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 10:</h2>
    <h3>28/11/18</h3>
    <p>Using images: Rich has made a site which shows the different ways of using images in HTML. As well as this I have learnt to use the anchor tags to link to different parts of the page and to other sites.</p>
    <h3>30/11/18</h3>
    <p>All peer reviews must be completed by today, I have 1 more to do and then I am all done. I believe I have given very thorough feedback, although this time it is to aid Rich when marking our work and not for my peers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 11:</h2>
    <h3>05/12/18</h3>
    <p>Looked more at the images this week. Deciding which techniques I can use on my website. We need to use the alt attribute on images. I am yet to put any images on my website. I know what I want my site to look like, I am just not sure how to do anything.</p>
    <p>Also through this exercise, I have been introduced to ID tags, these will come in handy when marking up my literature review. I think I will use ID tags to skip to the references at the bottom of the page, from clicking on the in-text citations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 12:</h2>
    <h3>12/12/18</h3>
    <p>Christmas Lecture! Rich made a christmas jumper using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h3>18/12/19</h3>
    <p>Over Christmas I have used YouTube tutorials and W3Schools to help me learn how to make a navbar. I would ideally like a transulcent nav bar that blurs content underneath on the scroll. I have found a way to blur to nav bar itself, but I am yet to find a solution to this problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 13:</h2>
    <h3>23/01/19</h3>
    <p>Worksheet - Addressing:</p>
    <p>Here are a list of websites I frequent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ASOS: https://www.asos.com/</li>
        <li>Google: https://www.google.com/</li>
        <li>Moodle: https://moodle.port.ac.uk/</li>
        <li>Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Looking back on my website reviews, I notice my attention is drawn more to functionality and stock controls systems and less about how it looks and is navigated. I never really thought about what went on behind the web page, whereas now I find myself inspecting web pages I like the look of to figure out how its been coded.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 14:</h2>
    <h3>30/01/19</h3>
    <p>Looking through the website marking scheme, I should mostly be alright. I know there is still plenty of improvements to be made. Which I will have to work on during the consolidation week and after getting back peer reviews.</p>

    <h3>02/02/19</h3>
    <p>I have discovered a few uses for #id tags, on my discovery log I wanted to link to the lit review notes template, but I wanted the link to be obvious, so had to give that a tag its own id so i could style it back to its original style</p>

    <h2>Week 15:</h2>
    <h3>06/02/19</h3>
    <p>This weeks lecture was on standards. How different industries have to comply with various standards such as ISO & BSI. At work we have recently achieved our ISO 9001 quality management badge, so I know a bit about these standards. I will look into internet standards, and read up on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>

    <h2>Week 16:</h2>
    <h3>13/02/19</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at usability, and how sometimes offering too much help can be perceived as patronising and/or annoying. We were reminded of Clippy the old Microsoft assistant, which to be honest I used to like, and enjoyed learning tricks from Clippy. I think I would have been too young to find Clippy patronising.</p>

    <h3>20/02/19</h3>
    
    <p>This week we wore different pairs of glasses to simulate what life would be like navigating the web with impaired vision or physical ability.</p>
    <p>It was quite funny watching people try and use their laptops, some couldn't even log in let alone open a web browser</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 18:</h2>
    <h3>27/02/19</h3>
    <p>This week we were shown how to upload our websites to the VM, and what folder to put them into. I can see that my website uploaded fine and into the correct folder by checking the monitoring system. This site also shows that my site is under 100mb.</p>
    <h3>28/02/19</h3>
    <p>Before the submission closes I want to find out how to put subtitles on my video. I will work on this tonight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 19:</h2>
    <h3>06/03/19</h3>
    <p>During consolidation week we had access to 10 websites belonging to our peers, that we needed to review and submit helpful feedback for. Every website looked very different, no two the same. I think I managed to provide very information replies to help other students, as well as learning new things myself, like how to provide a video in multiple formats.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Week 20:</h2>
    <h3>13/03/19</h3>
    <p>Now that we have our feedback available to look through, its annoying to see that some people haven't given me much feedback to work on. Some haven't even given me credit for using ID, Class & Element selectors. And aparently I haven't used an external stylesheet. Thankfully most people have looked through my website well enough. Although I will make sure to point out where I have achieved certain marks, to help the students review my website quicker and with ease.</p>

    <h2>Week 21:</h2>
    <h3>18/03/19</h3>
    <p>In this weeks lecture we have been shown more Java</p>
    <p>Im not ready to absorb Java yet, as still just trying to focus on my website. Ill catch up over easter... says every student.</p>

    <h3>19/03/19</h3>
    <p>I have been hunting to find out more about Aria labels. I would like to include these on my site, but I am not sure where they would be of use.</p>
    
    <h3>20/03/19</h3>
    <p>I have discovered how to use aria labels now. Here I have provided an example:</p>
    <button aria-label="Close">x</button>
    <p>This button has an aria-label which reads "Close".</p>
    <p>I was going to change my HTML & CSS checking links, to buttons and include aria-labels on those. But my validation flagged up an error saying that I could not have an a tag as the child of a button. I will have to research more into button rules.</p>
