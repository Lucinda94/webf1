    <h1>Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This review will look into the literature surrounding how personal information can be exposed online, and the steps users should take to avoid it. Personal information is becoming more public as people often do not take the right precautions when using the internet, mainly due to the rise of social networking sites (SNSs). It is reported that there are increasingly more incidents, concerning hacked accounts and exposed personal information with the expansion of SNSs, and with this sort of cybercrime appearing in the media, users are gradually becoming more aware of information security <a href="#ref6">(Ortiz, Chih, & Tsai, 2018).</a></p>
    <p>There are many studies that have investigated on this topic <a href="#ref1">(Chon, Lee, Jeong, Jowon Park & Jonghwa Park, 2018;</a> <a href="#ref4">Lankton, McKnight & Tripp, 2017;</a> <a href="#ref2">Farahbakhsh, Han, Cuevas, & Crespi, 2017)</a>, and others which study the security of browsing devices <a href="#ref3">(Gordon, 2007;</a> <a href="#ref5">NCSC Site, 2015;</a> <a href="#ref7">Pelton & Singh, 2015).</a> Also, some studies look into how trusted businesses also need to take precautions <a href="#ref5">(NCSC Site, 2015;</a>  <a href="#ref8">Talesh, 2017;</a> <a href="#ref9">Tankard, 2016).</a></p>
    
    <h2>AntiVirus, Spyware & Public WiFi.</h2>
    <p>A good place to start with protection online is having adequate antivirus / antimalware software installed. “These products, in most cases, should keep users safe from either malicious code which may steal data, or from visiting a phishing site” <a href="#ref3">(Gordon, 2007, p.37).</a> According to <a href="#ref5">The National Cyber Security Center (2015)</a>, up to date software may block malicious emails and prevent such malware being downloaded from websites. Although <a href="#ref3">Gordon (2007, p.37)</a> later mentions malware mutation capabilities are continually evolving, therefore malware companies cannot be completely up-to-date, allowing zero hour threats to pass through undetected. Zero hour threats being a flaw unknown to security professionals, and yet to be fixed.</p>
    
    <p> <a href="#ref7">Pelton and Singh (2015, pp.29-30)</a> assessed various software commercially available, and report that products such as ‘Avast’ and ‘Avira’ offer a basic level of protection for free. If your funds are limited it would be prudent to at least sign up to a free version. Pelton and Singh also claim there is a problem with using public WiFi that is either not password protected, or uses a very low level of protection that can be easily compromised <a href="#ref7">(p.84).</a> After an experiment by Avast, it was discovered that a large portion of mobile users browse on unprotected HTTP sites, therefore the Avast team were able to view browsing activity, web searches and even personal login information <a href="#ref7">(p.85).</a> Pelton and Singh suggest that public WiFi should be used with caution; never log into bank accounts or any other sensitive sites where your password could be exposed along with other private information <a href="#ref7">(p.86).</a></p>
    
    <h2>Social Networking</h2>
    <p><a href="#ref1">Chon et al. (2018, p.146)</a> report that the increase in popularity of SNS’s is threatening users privacy. Apparently, those who desire to express themselves publicly, are at risk of exposing a significant amount of personal information online which may result in being a victim of cybercrime e.g identity theft. <a href="#ref4">Lankton, McKnight and Tripp (2017, p.150)</a> recommend that Facebook users protect themselves by limiting self-disclosures. Although many people will disagree with what they define as personal and/or sensitive information, as some people choose to share more than others depending on their preferences.</p>
    
    <p><a href="#ref2">Farahbakhsh et al. (2017)</a> studied how information is publicly disclosed in Facebook profiles, by collecting and analyzing the 479k profiles from randomly selected Facebook users, which is an extremely considerable sample size. The friend-list appeared to be the feature with significant public exposure, with almost 63% of users making this publicly available. This would suggest that although most users are happy to share this information, 37% of users believe this could lead to a privacy issue. <a href="#ref2">Farahbakhsh et al. (2017)</a> also report that less than 3% of users disclose their age, which means users regard this information as highly private. Although as these statistics are based on what people share publicly, it is worth to mention age is one of the few attributes defaulted to ‘only friends’ on Facebook anyway. <a href="#ref2">Farahbakhsh et al. (2017)</a> later imply that users who share their interests on their profiles can result in personality characteristics and political leanings being derived. To mitigate this, Facebook allows each user to create a personalised level of privacy for particular features on their profile, such as the different privacy levels of “only me”, “friends”, “friends of friends”, “custom”, or “public”. Users can apply these settings against personal details in the ‘about section, or each time they post on their profile.</p>
    
    <h2>Businesses</h2>
    <p>“Doing nothing is no longer an option”(NCSC, 2015). <a href="#ref5">The National Cyber Security Center (2015)</a> says that preventing, detecting or disrupting the attack at the earliest opportunity can aid businesses in the defence against potential damage from cyber attacks. As well as appropriate antivirus and antimalware software, they say staff should recognise their role in maintaining a secure environment in the workplace and report anything suspicious. According to <a href="#ref8">Talesh (2017)</a>, existing research indicates that many businesses do not have the appropriate protection to prevent information exposure, and are not in compliance with privacy laws, and as <a href="#ref9">Tankard (2016)</a>states, businesses can now face extremely hefty fines if they do not comply with the new regulations, as under new the GDPR a minor breach can face up to a 2% fine of their global annual revenue or 10 million euros, whichever is higher, or for more serious offences, 4% of global annual revenue or 20 million euros, again whichever is higher.</p>
    
    <p><a href="#ref5">The National Cyber Security Center (2015)</a> has written an article on reducing your cyber attack for businesses, and post a threat report each week which illustrates recent attacks and continuing threats. It would be useful businesses to take advantage of this service, to mitigate exposure to cyber attack.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the majority of studies show how approaching the web with caution is the main framework for mitigating personal information exposure on the web. There are many opportunities for cybercriminals to slip the net, but having adequate information security awareness can benefit users with the knowledge of how to behave when using the internet. SNS’s privacy settings are there to help users maintain a level of privacy suitable for them, and should be used accordingly. On the other hand, as mentioned previously, malware is ever-evolving and cybercriminals will always exist, therefore protection against attacks will need to be ever-evolving also. Future research would look into who is more vulnerable online, how aware they are, and if there are any procedures in place to help protect them. And further study would also involve finding statistics on cyber attacks on businesses and if it correlates with lack of appropriate protection.</p>
